Dark Pattern Buster Hackathon

This repo currently consists of three features to bust Dark Patterns
1. Highlighter - This makes the border of the element containing dark patterns red with a width of 2px
2. DeepFake Detector - This can differentiate between fake and real images which will help the consumers to be wary of the recently rising deepfake adverts
3. Fake News Detector - It helps the consumer to be more aware about the current trends and protect them false news which may try to influence them to make certain assumptions and purchases
